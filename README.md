## For students

* Download the zipped folder quantitative-genetics-practical.zip.
* Unzip it: it should contain an HTML file called "questions.html" and a folder named "functions".
* Open the HTML file in your browser: it contains all the questions of the practical. Just follow through!
* You will need R in this practical. Open RStudio, and make sure to set your working directory to the folder you have just downloaded ("quantitative-genetics-practical"). * This way, R will know where to find the functions that you will be using in this practical.
